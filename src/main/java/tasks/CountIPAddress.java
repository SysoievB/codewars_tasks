 * Implement a function that receives two IPv4 addresses, and returns the number of addresses between

 * All inputs will be valid IPv4 addresses in the form of strings. The last address will always be
 * greater than the first one.
 * <p>
 * Examples
 * * With input "10.0.0.0", "10.0.0.50"  => return   50
 * * With input "10.0.0.0", "10.0.1.0"   => return  256
 * * With input "20.0.0.10", "20.0.1.0"  => return  246
